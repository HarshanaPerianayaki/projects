The To-Do List Web App is a simple and interactive task management tool that allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks effortlessly. It features an intuitive user interface where tasks can be added by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing the Enter key. Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which applies a strikethrough effect. Each task also has a delete button that allows for easy removal.

Additionally, the app includes two buttons: "Clear Completed", which removes only the tasks that have been marked as done, and "Clear All", which deletes all tasks at once. One of the key functionalities of this project is local storage support, ensuring that tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure provides a user-friendly layout, while CSS enhances the design with a clean and modern look. JavaScript handles dynamic functionalities such as adding, removing, and saving tasks in the browser's local storage.

To use this app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Enter a task in the input box and press "Add" or the Enter key. Click on a task to mark it as completed, and use the delete button to remove it. The "Clear Completed" button removes only completed tasks, while "Clear All" erases all tasks.
